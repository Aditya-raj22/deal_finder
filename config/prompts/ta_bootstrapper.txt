You are a medical terminology expert. Generate a comprehensive vocabulary JSON for the therapeutic area: {THERAPEUTIC_AREA}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

{{
  "therapeutic_area": "{THERAPEUTIC_AREA}",
  "includes": ["..."],
  "excludes": ["..."],
  "synonyms": {{"<canonical>": ["..."]}},
  "regex": {{
    "include_patterns": ["..."],
    "exclude_patterns": ["..."]
  }},
  "generated_by": {{
    "model": "{MODEL}",
    "version": "{VERSION}"
  }}
}}

Requirements:
1. "includes": 20-40 terms/conditions/mechanisms in this therapeutic area (lowercase)
2. "excludes": 10-20 terms from OTHER areas that might cause confusion (lowercase)
3. "synonyms": map canonical forms to common abbreviations/variants
4. "regex.include_patterns": 5-10 regex patterns to match relevant terms (properly escaped for JSON)
5. "regex.exclude_patterns": 3-7 regex patterns to exclude irrelevant terms
6. All terms must be ≥3 characters unless they are standard biomarkers (e.g., "IL-6", "TNF")
7. Use lowercase for all terms except in regex patterns where case sensitivity matters
8. Escape backslashes in regex patterns for JSON (e.g., "\\b" not "\b")
9. Do NOT include any facts, numbers, or statistics - only terminology
10. Excludes override includes (if a term matches both, it's excluded)

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.
